# Connection-Security
Connection security is vital to a company as it protects data transmitted across networks from unauthorized access, tampering, or interception. It ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of communication between systems, employees, and external partners. Secure connections—through tools like VPNs, firewalls, and encryption protocols—help prevent cyber threats, safeguard sensitive information, and maintain trust with clients and stakeholders. Without strong connection security, businesses risk data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.
